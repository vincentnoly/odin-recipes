            <li>1/3 cup water</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated pepper Jack cheese (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>For the Dough:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1.2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>12 tablespoons cold unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1.3 cup cold water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pout olive oil into a saucepan; add onion, poblano, garlic, salt, pepper, chipotle, cumin, oregano, cayenne, and cooked chicken, pressing down as you got. Add currants.</li>
            <li>Place saucepan over high heat; cook until onions begin to soften slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir in diced tomatoes with green chiles. Pour in 1/3 cup water and mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Bring mixture to a simmer; reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquids are cooked down, 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Chill thoroughly before use, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>While filling simmers, combine flour, salt, and sugar for dough in a bowl with your hand. Grate in cold butter, pausing as needed to combine. Drizzle in beaten egg and water. Mix with a fork until it starts to form a shaggy dough.</li>
            <li>Use your hands to squeeze mixture into a lump of dough; transfer to a work surface and knead into a ball of dough, 10 to 15 seconds.</li>
            <li>Wrap doughh in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Unwrap chilled dough and transfer to a lightly floured work surface. Use a bench scraper to divide into 8 equal pieces.</li>
            <li>Roll each dough piece into an 8-inch circle.</li>
            <li>Drain any excess juice from filling. Top each dough circle with a rounded 1/2-cup measure of the chicken mixture. Sprinkle some pepper Jack cheese over top.</li>
            <li>Brush edges of each dough circle with a small amount of water to dampen; fold over and seal with fingertips, making sure to not trap in any pockets of air. Crimp using your fingertips or a fork.</li>
            <li>Combine beaten egg and 2 teaspoons water for egg wash. Transfer empanadas to the prepared baking sheet and brush over egg wash. Sprinkle with cayenne.</li>
            <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until browned and crispy on the edges, about 35 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool for about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
